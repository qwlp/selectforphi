# Intersect

An intersection is very similar to an inner join but there are subtle differences. For Example:

* An INNER JOIN will return duplicates, if an id column is duplicated in either table. INTERSECT removes duplicates.
* An INNER JOIN will never return NULL, but INTERSECT will return NULL.
* INNER JOIN is an operator that generally matches on a limited set of columns and can return zero rows or more rows from either table. INTERSECT is a set-based operator that compares complete rows between two sets and can never return more rows than in the smaller table.

```SQL
SELECT *
FROM employees

INTERSECT

SELECT *
FROM department;
```

## Assignment

Instead of performing a simple join, perform an intersection between the `users` table and `countries` table.

* Write an `INTERSECT` between `users` and `countries`
* Return *all* fields which are non-duplicates from both tables
