## Unions

In the case that we want to perform/simulate a full join, we can use a **union**.

A union combines the results of both table, basically smashing them together, removing any duplicates.
* Note: **UNION ALL** does not remove duplicates.

```sql
SELECT
    c.customer_id,
    c.customer_name,
    o.order_id,
    o.order_date
FROM
    Customers c
LEFT JOIN
    Orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id

UNION

SELECT
    c.customer_id,
    c.customer_name,
    o.order_id,
    o.order_date
FROM
    Customers c
RIGHT JOIN
    Orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;
```

## Assignment

Our finance team wants to find the each user's transaction. Write a single SQL query that simulates a FULL OUTER JOIN between the `users` table and the `transactions` table using a LEFT JOIN, a RIGHT JOIN, and a UNION operator. Select the following columns:

* `users.name` (aliased as user_name)
* `transactions.id` (aliased as transaction_id)
* `transactions.amount` (aliased as transaction_amount)
