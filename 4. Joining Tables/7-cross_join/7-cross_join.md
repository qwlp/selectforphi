# Cross Join

A CROSS JOIN in MySQL creates the Cartesian product of the two tables, meaning every row from the first table is combined with every row from the second table. This is often used for generating combinations or permutations.

* Cartesian product gives you every possible combination between them.

Example:

## Assignment

Write a query that performs a CROSS JOIN between the `users` table and the `countries` table. Select the `name` of the user and the `name` of the country.
